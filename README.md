This Maze game is a labyrinth game developed as a C project for a Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this game, you need to navigate from a starting point to the endpoint to earn points.

You control the movement using the WASD keys.

At the start, the game asks which difficulty level you want to play on, and after selecting the difficulty letter, the maze appears.

You receive 1 point for each successful level completion.

Important: DO NOT spam the WASD keys near the goal.
